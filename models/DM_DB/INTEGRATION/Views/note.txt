note - 

1. 
when doing intial setup, follow the sql execution orders in MAIN-SCRIPT-DEV

2. 
when doing intial setup, if any views fail due to some views do not exist yet in Snowflake
    example is RC_UPDATE_CASE_DELETIONS_ALL.sql - INTEGRATION.SRC_FORMS_RAW or GENERATE_ALL_VIEWS.sql
    perform dbt run again, the needed view (INTEGRATION.SRC_FORMS_RAW0) should be gernated in Snowflake from the first dbt run
 

2. 
when testing with dbt show
example -> dbt show -s CASE_FIELD_VALUES_STG --target dev 

Runtime Error
  Database Error in model SRC_UPDATE_CASE_DELETIONS_STAGE (models/DM_DB/INTEGRATION/Views/SRC_UPDATE_CASE_DELETIONS_STAGE.sql)
    002003 (42S02): SQL compilation error:
    Object 'SRC_FORMS_RAW_STAGE' does not exist or not authorized.

temporary add INTEGRATION schema into the view and run show again
    FROM 
        INTEGRATION.SRC_CASES_RAW_STAGE,
